### Template for DTR Memo

Project: FitLit 

Group Member Names: Jeff Kersting Kevin Hartmann

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
 We hope to gain a better working knowledge of the following:
<ul>
  <li>DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>Local storage</li>
  <li>Data model</li>
  <li>Collaborative workflow</li>
</ul>
Kevin: As a team, we plan to complete up to iteration 3, with plans to begin work/understanding of iteration 4 concepts.
Jeff: Have a better understanding of the github workflow in a collaborative environment.
Team: We plan to check in for ten minutes after each work session to cover the following:
<ul>
  <li>Did you feel left behind during work today?</li>
  <li>Were there any aspects of the code written today that you didn't understand?</li>
  <li>How are you feeling about the project (the application, our collaboration, our goals)?</li>
  <li>What goals do we want to accomplish during next meet time?</li>
  <li>For applicable questions, we will use the fist-to-five method of feedback</li>
</ul>
We plan to stay up to date on our project kanban, and gauge our programming success on our completion of the items within. We plan to guage our collaborative success based on the work session check-ins and overall group understanding. 
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Jeff strengths:
<ul>
  <li>Conducting independent research and conveying the findings</li>
  <li>Enthusiasm towards the collaborative environment</li>
  <li>Openness to criticism and negative feedback</li>
</ul>
Kevin strengths:
<ul>
  <li>Exploratory in learning</li>
  <li>Willing to try new approaches to problem solving</li>
  <li>Communication and active listening</li>
</ul>

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
We will use these strengths to ensure a high level of group learning equity, as well as understanding. We will also use these strengths to ensure that we have a friendly and open collaborative experience.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
Tuesday: 6:00-8:00
Wednesday: 5:30-8:00
Thursday: Project work hours
Friday: 8:00 through project worktime
Saturday: Day off (Halloween)
Sunday: 8:00-10:00
Monday: 5:30-8:00
Tuesday: TBD
Wednesday: 5:30-8:00

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
See goals and expectations for check-in questions. Outside of scheduled group work, we will check our slack thread. 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
<ul>
  <li>Local storage</li>
  <li>DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>Class constructors incorpotated into DOM manipulation</li>
  <li>Data modeling</li>
</ul>

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
We will write all code during collaborative hours to ensure group learning.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 
We will always make new branches to work on specific features. We will conduct code reviews during group work time. We will utilize a PR template.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
30 minutes on 5 minutes off, with 10 minute breaks every hour.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We will be open to giving and receiving feedback, making sure to stick to this plan via the kanban. We will assume positive intent. Follow the ideas presented in the feedback model(kind, actionable, specific).

Additional Remote Considerations:
We are all on the same timezone, so it should be business as usual.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
Kanban, github pages, tuple, slack, pomodoro timer.

Day 1 Agenda: 
Build HTML framework and begin CSS styling.
